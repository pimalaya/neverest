## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: full rewrite on top of the I/O-free `io-*` ecosystem (`io-email`, `io-imap`, `io-jmap`, `io-m2dir`) plus `pimalaya-cli` / `pimalaya-config` / `pimalaya-stream`. The CLI, the configuration schema and the sync engine all changed shape; see [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for the upgrade path from v0.1.0.

### Added

- **JMAP** backend support via `io-jmap`.
- **m2dir** as the new local sync target (replaces Maildir).

### Removed

- **Notmuch** backend (no replacement in the `io-*` ecosystem yet).
- **Maildir** as a sync target (superseded by m2dir).
