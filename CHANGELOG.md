## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-07

Neverest 0.2 is a full rewrite on top of the I/O-free `io-*` ecosystem. The CLI, the configuration schema and the sync engine all changed shape.

[MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) carries the upgrade path from v0.1.0. Nothing of an old setup is read: the configuration is rewritten and the first run starts from an empty store.

### Added

- Added the local **pimdir store**, the single local copy an app reads.

  One store per account at `neverest/<account>/` under the platform's state location (`$XDG_STATE_HOME` on Linux and the BSDs, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%` on Windows), overridable with `store.root`: a SQLite index beside a content-addressed blob directory. Its presence is what says the account is initialized.

  Every collection is grouped under the account that syncs it and carries a display name, so a frontend reads `Work` where the id says `caldav/ED99C7C8`. Every item carries a sort key and a typed summary row, so a collection lists in its natural order without reading a body.

- Added the `init` command, run once per account before the first sync.

  It opens every source first, so credential and network errors surface up front. `sync` refuses to run without it, and `init` refuses to run over it.

- Added **named endpoints and a declared mode**: a `sources` table, optionally a `targets` one, and the flags `one-way` and `retain`.

  A map key is the pimdir source id, so a name is what every binding it owns is recorded under; a positional list would reassign them all on a reorder.

  A backend written directly under the account (`imap.server = "…"`) is sugar for a source named after its protocol, and the only shape the wizard writes.

  One source and one target sync both ways, several targets are one-way only, and several sources with no target is the offline replica. Every other combination is refused at load, naming the nearest legal one.

  An account may hold sources of several kinds: mail, contacts and calendar under one store.

- Added `one-way`, which declares authority rather than leaving both sides to merge.

  The `sources` side wins and the other's change is discarded, so nothing is reported as a conflict. The other side is still enumerated every run, or every item would be re-pushed.

- Added `retain`, which declares whether the store is a replica or only the ledger.

  The store is the ledger in every mode, holding the spine and the checkpoints. `retain` says whether it also holds bodies, defaulting from the destination: true with no target, false with one.

  `retain = true` alongside targets is honoured rather than refused, since migrating while keeping a copy is a thing to want. It makes the store a backup, so `sync --reset` then destroys data.

- Added the **mode guard**: the mode is stamped beside the store and compared on every run.

  Turning `one-way` on over an account that synced both ways is refused, that run being the one that discards what the previous mode merged. `sync --accept-mode` records the answer.

- Added **CardDAV** and **CalDAV** support via [io-webdav](https://github.com/pimalaya/io-webdav), behind the `dav` cargo feature.

  Address books and calendars are collections, keyed by their path segment and named by their `DAV:displayname`. Enumeration is RFC 6578 `sync-collection`, its token the engine's checkpoint; a server implementing none is listed with a `PROPFIND` instead.

  These are the first mutable-content backends, so they are the first to exercise revisions, conditional writes and conflicts, which mail leaves inert. Writes are `PUT` and `DELETE` on the last-synced ETag, so a remote that moved is rejected rather than overwritten.

  A link id is the vCard or iCalendar `UID`, falling back to a body digest. A calendar item is the object **resource**, not the component, so a recurring series and its overrides are one item (RFC 4791 §4.1).

- Added **Microsoft Graph** support via `io-msgraph`, behind the `msgraph` cargo feature, which is **not** a default.

  Delta-query enumeration, bodies through the raw MIME endpoint, flag and delete pushes. Appends and moves are pull-only, and auth is a bearer token from an external broker.

  Graph carries three domains behind one protocol and this backend syncs only mail, so a released binary is built without it. Build with `--features msgraph` meanwhile.

- Added the queued **`submit` intent** and its send channel.

  A frontend enqueues a submission through the store's action queue, and the row pins the body until the send. Every run performs the pending ones through the one source offering a channel.

  A transient failure leaves the row pending, a permanent one parks it. Submission is at-least-once, so deduplication is the receiving provider's job.

  The `smtp` table mirrors the `imap` one field for field. Omitting `sasl` is the unauthenticated relay, which stops after `EHLO`.

- Added `store.purge-after`, the retention sweep.

  The store retains an item rather than deleting it when its last binding vanishes. Each sync then purges every retained item older than this delay (`"90d"`, `"12h"`, `"0"`), collects garbage, and reports what it reclaimed.

  Unset never purges, `"0"` reproduces a terminal delete, and `sync --no-purge` skips one run. Beside a read-only source it makes a backup a remote expunge cannot lose.

- Added the **three-way merge** a run resolves a content conflict with.

  Most divergence is not disagreement: one side changed a phone number and the other a note, and the base the last sync agreed on says which side touched which field.

  Two endpoints of one account are merged against the body they both came from, which no endpoint's own reconcile can see. Both sides setting one field differently parks for a person.

  The merge is built in rather than configured: a pure function over stored bodies, with no taste in it. Mail is immutable-content and reaches none of it.

- Added the `conflict` command, the only place a collision is decided.

  `conflict list` names what is waiting, `conflict show <id>` prints the three bodies, and `conflict resolve <id>` settles one. `--prefer-local` and `--prefer-remote` discard a side, which a person may ask for by name and a run must never do on its own.

  Neverest raises no notification of its own: `--json` carries `conflicts` and `outstandingConflicts`, so a caller notifies on entry with no state to keep.

- Added `conflict.merger` and `conflict resolve --interactive`, handing a collision to a program of your own.

  The four paths are appended git-mergetool style. A command naming `{base}`, `{local}`, `{remote}` or `{output}` is substituted instead, which is the form `tcard merge` and `tcal merge` take.

  The result is taken only on a zero exit with the output written, since an editor exits zero on a bare quit, and only when it is a body of that item. No lock is held across the merger.

- Added exit code 2 for a run that reconciled its collections and still left something waiting.

  A parked conflict, a refused duplicate `UID` and a rejected write are one class: unresolved, re-reported every run, unchanged by a rerun. Failing instead would stop ten thousand items over one duplicated phone number.

  The outstanding count sits beside it in both output modes, read from the store rather than the run's tally.

- Added a warnings section for what a run could not deliver, under `refused` and `rejected` in `--json`.

  A refused create names the side, the collection and the `UID`; a rejected write names its reason and takes back the hunk, so a run that wrote nothing never reads as having written. Neverest repairs neither: which copy to keep is the user's call.

- Added the per-account sync.lock advisory file lock, so two concurrent runs cannot corrupt the store.

  It honours `store.root`, and a second run waits up to 60 seconds before exiting with a clear error.

- Added the store's action queue, neverest being its sole owner: every run drains it before it syncs.

  The queue drains store-wide in append order, the store applying each action as the source syncing its collection, so a queued action never waits for the side that owns its namespace. Each is applied exactly once.

- Added the engine's answer to a delete a source may not push: held beside another source of the collection, reverted for a source alone.

  A local edit whose member the server deleted is re-staged as a pending create rather than dropped.

- Added the **handle-space rebuild**: an IMAP `UIDVALIDITY` change drives io-pimdir's rekey.

  Bodies, summaries and pending state carry over by link id, and the collection's `generation` bumps atomically, so a frontend derives its epoch from the store alone.

- Added `--log-level` (alias `--log`) and `--log-file <PATH>`, where only `RUST_LOG` used to work.

- Added `sync --source <name>`, narrowing a run to the named sources.

- Added the `<protocol>.item.update` permission, gating in-place body edits.

  It defaults to `true` and only bites on a mutable-content backend.

- Added the `json-schema` command, describing what each data command prints under `--json`.

  One schema per command path, to stdout or one file per command with `--dir`. A consumer reading `conflicts` out of the sync payload has the shape written down rather than inferred.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: the sync engine runs on the [io-pimdir](https://github.com/pimalaya/io-pimdir) engine instead of a hand-rolled three-way diff.

  An account's sources are the sources of one shared collection, so cross-source propagation of items, flags and deletions falls out of the shared hub. The store services the engine's storage seam; neverest's driver answers the remote.

- **BREAKING**: `left` and `right` are gone, replaced by the `sources` and `targets` tables and the `one-way` flag.

  They are refused at load in any form, naming what declares the direction they never could.

- **BREAKING**: the sync vocabulary is kind-neutral, turning a mail sync into a generic PIM sync.

  Everything above the backend seam speaks collections and items rather than folders and messages. The `folder` and `message` tables became `collection` and `item`, and so did the per-source permission tables.

  `-f` / `--include-folder`, `--exclude-folder` and `--all-folders` became `-m` / `--include-collection`, `--exclude-collection` and `--all-collections`.

- **BREAKING**: every `--json` key is camelCase, and `-o json` is now `--json`.

  camelCase matches the wire formats the endpoints speak and keeps every key reachable by dot access in jq, which neither `outstanding_conflicts` nor `message-id` was. TOML keys stay kebab-case.

- **BREAKING**: `collection.filter` belongs to the source it filters rather than to the account.

  An `include = ["INBOX"]` means nothing to a contacts source, so filters are asymmetric: a collection may be synced on one source and skipped on another.

- **BREAKING**: the SMTP submission channel belongs to the source it completes.

  Written `sources.<name>.smtp.*`, or `smtp.*` under an account whose mail backend is the sugar. Two channels are refused at load rather than resolved by configuration order.

- **BREAKING**: per-source permissions are enforced per operation.

  They map onto the engine's per-kind push rights one to one, and a forbidden kind stays pending while the others propagate. A tightened block takes effect now where it previously did not.

- **BREAKING**: renamed `synchronize` to `sync`, `check-up` to `check`, and `completions` and `manuals` to `completion` and `manual`, the plurals staying as hidden aliases.

  The positional `<account>` became an optional `-a` / `--account <NAME>`, falling back to the entry marked `default = true`.

- **BREAKING**: `check` and `init` print one payload rather than a run of prose lines.

  Separate messages meant several JSON documents on stdout and nothing a parser could read.

- Every `server` accepts a bare authority, port included, as well as a full URL.

  An authority takes the backend's default scheme, so `posteo.de:8843` resolves rather than reaching a backend hostless.

- Every configured secret resolves once per run instead of once per opened connection.

  A `password.command` used to be spawned inside the connection layer, so one source at `-j 4` ran it four times before its first request. A run now resolves them up front, memoizing identical commands.

  A credential that fails resolves against its own endpoint rather than the account, so a stale calendar entry no longer leaves mail unsynced. Nothing is logged but the command and its duration.

- The configuration wizard asks for a single input, an email address, and derives the account name from its domain.

  Discovery runs every mechanism in parallel (provider rules, PACC, Thunderbird Autoconfiguration, RFC 6186 SRV, RFC 6764 DAV) under a deadline, and every reachable service is proposed.

  Only backends compiled into the running build are offered, and only the SASL mechanisms the server advertises.

- `neverest configure` generates an account and never edits one.

  It appends the generated `[accounts.<name>]` table as plain text, so comments, ordering and hand-written formatting survive. The name is suffixed until free, and the account claims `default` only when no other does.

  `--json` or a redirected stdout prints the account and touches no file, so `neverest configure > config.toml` works. Editing one is a job for your editor, against [config.sample.toml](./config.sample.toml).

- The IMAP and SMTP `alpn` fields are optional rather than defaulted in place, so io-imap and io-smtp own their own default.

  The SMTP channel therefore offers the `smtp` ALPN token (RFC 7595) where it offered none. Set `smtp.alpn = []` to restore the old behaviour.

- Every remote is a cargo feature: `imap`, `msgraph`, `dav` (CardDAV and CalDAV together), plus `smtp`.

  All ship in the default set except `msgraph`. Every source config parses in every build, and opening a backend that was not compiled in reports it at runtime.

- Linked the system SQLite by default: `vendored` builds it from source alongside OpenSSL, so a plain `cargo install` needs sqlite3 headers and a released binary carries its own.

- Relicensed from `AGPL-3.0-only` to `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, aligning with the rest of the Pimalaya ecosystem.

- Bumped the Pimalaya libraries: io-pimdir 0.5, io-imap 0.6, io-smtp 0.3, io-webdav 0.3, io-http 0.5, io-pim-discovery 0.7, io-msgraph 0.3, ical-rs 0.5, vcard-rs 0.4, pimalaya-stream 0.3, pimalaya-cli 0.2 and pimalaya-config 0.2.

  SASL moved out of pimalaya-stream into the new io-sasl crate, so the SCRAM-SHA-256 the configuration has always offered is now runnable. The minimum supported Rust version is 1.89.

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: removed local file backends as sync sources (Maildir, then m2dir).

  A source is a remote and the pimdir store is the local replica, so a local file store beside it would be a second local copy. An existing tree comes in through io-pimdir's conversion tooling.

- **BREAKING**: removed the **Notmuch** backend, with no replacement in the `io-*` ecosystem yet.

- **BREAKING**: removed `folder.aliases`.

  The table parsed and nothing ever read it: substituting a friendly name for a backend id is display work, and neverest renders nothing. The store carries display metadata for the frontend that does.

- **BREAKING**: removed the built-in keyring and OAuth support.

  Secrets come from a command instead, so any secret manager works, and [ortie](https://github.com/pimalaya/ortie) issues and refreshes OAuth access tokens.

- **BREAKING**: removed `envelope.filter`, the `-o` output flag and the `-C` / `--color` flag.

  Color follows the terminal, and `--json` replaces `-o json`.
